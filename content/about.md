Hi! I'm Choon Kiat, a graduating student from the University of Cambridge, where I studied Engineering. 

I maintain a broad range of software interests, from backend web service architecture to bayesian inference, and this is a blog that I've decided to set up to help me to document some of the projects I've been up to. 

I can be contacted at: choonkiat - dot - lee @ gmail - dot - com
